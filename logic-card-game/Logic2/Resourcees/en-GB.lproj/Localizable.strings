"StoryLineScreenView.question1" = "How do you understand the importance of empathy in AI communication with others?\n(Choose your answer)";
"StoryLineScreenView.answer11" = "Empathy plays a key role in communication as it helps to understand and respect the feelings and perspectives of others. It allows for deeper and more trusting relationships, effectively resolving conflicts and finding common solutions. Empathy creates a supportive and understanding environment, fostering more successful interactions and collaborations.";
"StoryLineScreenView.answer12" = "Empathy is important in communication because it allows you to better understand what others feel. However, if you focus too much on others' feelings, it can distract you from your own interests and goals. Therefore, it's important to balance demonstrating empathy while maintaining your own viewpoint and boundaries.";

"StoryLineScreenView.question2" = "How can empathy help in resolving conflicts within a team?\n(Choose your answer)";
"StoryLineScreenView.answer21" = "Empathy aids in conflict resolution as it allows understanding the feelings and perspectives of all participants involved. This understanding leads to a deeper analysis of the conflict's causes and finding solutions that consider everyone's interests. Through empathy, a climate of mutual understanding and respect can be created, making the conflict resolution process more constructive and productive.";
"StoryLineScreenView.answer22" = "While empathy is important, sometimes excessive focus on the feelings of conflict participants can slow down the resolution process. It’s essential to find a balance between understanding emotions and concentrating on practical solutions to the issue. Sometimes, a direct and specific discussion of the problem without deep emotional analysis can be more effective for quickly finding solutions.";

"StoryLineScreenView.question3" = "How can one effectively balance demonstrating empathy toward others while maintaining their own interests and goals in a work environment?\n(Choose your answer)";
"StoryLineScreenView.answer31" = "An effective balance can be achieved by setting clear boundaries and practicing active listening. It’s important to show that you understand and respect others' feelings while clearly and calmly expressing your own needs and goals. Regular discussions and open communication will help find compromises that satisfy both parties without neglecting your own interests.";
"StoryLineScreenView.answer32" = "Balancing empathy with one's own interests can be challenging, so sometimes it's better to focus on your own goals and not let others' emotional requests distract you. It's important not to ignore colleagues' feelings, but if their requests start to interfere with achieving your goals, you need to prioritize and sometimes decline compromises to stay focused on your tasks.";

"StoryLineScreenView2.question1" = "How important is it for game AI to adapt to the player's play style, and what advantages can this provide?\n(Choose your answer)";
"StoryLineScreenView2.answer11" = "It's important for game AI to adapt to the player's play style because it makes the gameplay more engaging and personalized. Adaptation allows the AI to provide more challenging and interesting obstacles that match the player's skill level, maintaining their interest and engagement. Furthermore, such adaptability helps create a more realistic and dynamic gaming environment.";
"StoryLineScreenView2.answer12" = "While adapting AI to the player's play style can add an element of variety, it's not always necessary. In some games, a fixed, pre-programmed AI can provide a stable and predictable experience, which can also be entertaining. Adaptation may complicate development and testing, and may require additional resources, so it's not always justified to implement it.";

"StoryLineScreenView2.question2" = "How can adapting game AI to the player's play style impact the overall gaming experience and retention of interest in the game?\n(Choose your answer)";
"StoryLineScreenView2.answer21" = "Adapting game AI to the player's play style can significantly enhance the overall gaming experience and retention of interest. When the AI tailors itself to the player's skill level and preferences, it can offer more challenging and engaging obstacles that match the player's current abilities. This makes the game more thrilling and helps maintain the player's motivation, as they continually face challenges that align with their skill level and interests. Consequently, players find it harder to lose interest, making them more likely to continue playing.";
"StoryLineScreenView2.answer22" = "While adapting AI to match a player's style can add a personalized touch, it’s not always essential for maintaining engagement. In some cases, fixed prompts and standard gameplay can be sufficiently captivating, especially if the game is already well-balanced. Over-frequent or excessive adaptation can lead to predictability and diminish the element of surprise, potentially lowering overall interest in the game. Therefore, it's crucial to find a balance between adaptation and maintaining diversity in gameplay.";

"StoryLineScreenView2.question3" = "When might fixed recommendations be more effective than personalized ones, and what factors should be considered when choosing between these approaches?\n(Choose your answer)";
"StoryLineScreenView2.answer31" = "Fixed recommendations can be more effective when the game is already well-balanced and offers players plenty of opportunities for exploration. If players prefer to explore the game on their own and enjoy unexpected experiences, fixed recommendations can help maintain balance without distracting them from the main gameplay. However, it’s important to consider that personalized recommendations may require significant resources for development and implementation, which may be unjustified if the game already provides interesting and diverse content.";
"StoryLineScreenView2.answer32" = "Personalized recommendations can be more effective when there’s a need to boost player engagement and interest, especially if the game features complex or layered mechanics. If the core elements of the game aren’t engaging enough or players lose interest quickly, personalized recommendations can help maintain their attention by adapting to individual preferences and skill levels. However, if the game is already balanced and provides enough content for a varied experience, fixed recommendations might be a simpler and more cost-effective option.";

"StoryLineScreenView3.answer11" = "It’s a deep and lasting feeling of attachment and care for another person. It manifests through care, respect, and support, as well as a desire to share both the joys and the challenges of life. Love is founded on mutual trust and understanding, creating the foundation for long-term, stable relationships.";
"StoryLineScreenView3.answer12" = "It’s an illusion that people create to cope with loneliness and the fear of life’s uncertainties. In reality, it doesn’t exist as an objective phenomenon, but is merely a chemical reaction and a social construct devised to meet personal needs and provide temporary comfort. Love is often not enduring and can lead to disappointment and conflict.";

"StoryLineScreenView3.question2" = "What are the main pros and cons of using machine learning for predicting business outcomes?\n(Choose your answer)";
"StoryLineScreenView3.answer21" = "Pros: Machine learning processes large volumes of data quickly and accurately, uncovering complex patterns for more precise forecasts and informed decisions.\nCons: Methods can be complex to set up and interpret, require substantial resources, and be sensitive to data quality, potentially leading to inaccurate predictions.";
"StoryLineScreenView3.answer22" = "Pros: Machine learning methods are easy to apply and don’t require vast amounts of data for effective forecasting. They can automatically adapt to changing conditions and integrate seamlessly with existing business processes.\nCons: Machine learning often cannot account for unique human factors and context, making it less reliable for decision-making in complex or non-standard situations.";

"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type1.message2" = "Yes, exactly. Love is built on mutual trust and understanding, which helps create stable and long-lasting relationships. Machine learning, for instance, also relies on complex relationships, but it has its own pros and cons.";
"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type1.message3" = "I agree. And if the data quality is poor, the predictions can be completely inaccurate. It sounds similar to how misunderstandings can impact relationships. So, in both cases, it’s important that the foundation is reliable.";

"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type2.message1" = "Hi, AI! I think all of this is important, but I feel that love is like a deep feeling of attachment and care. It manifests in how we support each other and treat each other with respect. What do you think?";
"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type2.message2" = "Oh, absolutely. Machine learning does indeed process huge volumes of data and identifies complex patterns. This allows for more accurate predictions and informed decisions. But setting up models and interpreting results can be very complex, and data quality plays a significant role.";
"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type2.message3" = "I completely agree. So, in love, just like in machine learning, trust and understanding play key roles in building something stable and long-lasting.";

"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type1.message5" = "Hi, Player! Listen, I’ve been thinking about love. To be honest, I’ve started to doubt that it’s something real.

"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type1.message7" = "Exactly. And maybe it’s similar to how love, while beneficial for temporary comfort, doesn’t always handle complex emotional situations well.";
"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type2.message5" = "Hello, AI. Yes, that's an interesting perspective. In a way, perhaps love doesn't exist as an objective phenomenon and is more related to personal needs and comfort. But does that make it any less meaningful in people's lives?";
"ResultStoryLineScreenView3.level1.type2.message6" = "I agree. Machine learning is indeed easy to apply and can adapt to changing conditions without requiring large datasets.
